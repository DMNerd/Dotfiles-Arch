## Related packages

My prefered AUR helper is [YAY](https://github.com/Jguer/yay "YAY"). I'll be using it to install everything (no matter if it is accesible form the official Arch repos)

### I3
I use I3 fork called [i3-gaps-next](https://github.com/Airblader/i3/tree/gaps-next "i3-gaps-next") 
Instalation:
`yay -S i3-gaps-next-git`

#### Other packages related to my I3 config 
`yay -S xkbset xorg-xinput libinput-gestures nitrogen redshift-gtk polkit-gnome xfce4-power-manager pcmanfm vscodium-bin`

### Polybar
The bar I settled for is [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar "Polybar") 
Instalation:
`yay -S polybar`

### ROFI
[Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi "Rofi") is hands down the best launcher (honourable mention to [Albert](https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert "Albert") , sadly not really functional under I3 but on gnome, it was my preffered launcher)

### COMPTON
I Use fork of compton called  [compton-kawase-blur](https://github.com/GabrielTenma/compton-kawase-blur "compton-kawase-blur") 
`yay -S compton-tryone-git`
